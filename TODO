* handling inside strings is not quite right, need to pop out of them
  (moving to end that is closest to point)
* when starting inside a string it's possible to end up at the last
  quote instead of on the comma
* ws handling isn't quite right
* use syntax tables for looking-at expression so this works in more
  languages (eg. elisp, C++)
* documentation
* square brackets and brace too (should come for free when using syntax tables)
